      "value": "A Use After Free vulnerability in the Layer 2 Address Learning Manager (l2alm) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX Series allows an adjacent attacker to cause the Packet Forwarding Engine to crash and restart, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). The PFE may crash when a lot of MAC learning and aging happens, but due to a Race Condition (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization) that is outside the attackers direct control. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 19.4R3-S10 on QFX Series; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S7 on QFX Series; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S6 on QFX Series; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S5 on QFX Series; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S4 on QFX Series; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S3 on QFX Series; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S3 on QFX Series; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3 on QFX Series; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3 on QFX Series; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2 on QFX Series."
