      "value": "The vulnerability is to theft of arbitrary files with system privilege in the LockScreenSettings (\"com.lge.lockscreensettings\") app in the \"com/lge/lockscreensettings/dynamicwallpaper/MyCategoryGuideActivity.java\" file. The main problem is that the app launches implicit intents that can be intercepted by third-party apps installed on the same device. They also can return arbitrary data that will be passed to the \"onActivityResult()\" method. The LockScreenSettings app copies the received file to the \"/data/shared/dw/mycategory/wallpaper_01.png\" path and then changes the file access mode to world-readable and world-writable."
