Project administrators can run these imports, which could cause Allura to read local files and expose them.\u00a0 Exposing internal files then can lead to other exploits, like session hijacking, or remote code execution.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Allura from 1.0.1 through 1.15.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.16.0, which fixes the issue.\u00a0 If you are unable to upgrade, set \"disable_entry_points.allura.importers = forge-tracker, forge-discussion\" in your .ini config file.\n\n"
