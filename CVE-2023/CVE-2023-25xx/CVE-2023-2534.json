User IDs can easily be correlated with real names e. g. via\nticket histories by any user. (Fuzzing for garnering other adjacent user/sensitive data).\u00a0Subscribing to all possible push events could also lead to performance implications on the server side, depending on the size of the installation\nand the number of active users.
