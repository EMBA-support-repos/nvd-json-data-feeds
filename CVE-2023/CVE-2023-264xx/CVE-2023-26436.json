Access to this API endpoint is restricted to local networks by default. Arbitrary code could be injected that is being executed when processing the request. A check has been introduced to restrict processing of legal and expected classes for this API. We now log a warning in case there are attempts to inject illegal classes. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n"
