      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: hda: intel-sdw-acpi: harden detection of controller\n\nThe existing code currently sets a pointer to an ACPI handle before\nchecking that it's actually a SoundWire controller. This can lead to\nissues where the graph walk continues and eventually fails, but the\npointer was set already.\n\nThis patch changes the logic so that the information provided to\nthe caller is set when a controller is found."
