Reason: This candidate was privately assigned by a CNA to an issue, but the issue was published through separate channels and assigned a new identifier by the MITRE CNA, so it is a duplicate of CVE-2005-3150. Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2005-3150 instead of this candidate.  All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage."
